     * sTraversalPath when it is first instantiated, and our onLayout callback uses sTraversalPath
     * to set mPath using the method sTraversalPath.transform(scale, mPath))
     *
     * Then comes the big switch:
     * R.id.named_components: "Named Components" Uses the named "x" and "y" properties for
     *     individual (x, y) coordinates of the Path and sets them on the view object. The
     *     setX(float) and setY(float) methods are called on view. An int version of this
     *     method also exists for animating int Properties. This is accomplished by creating
     *     an ObjectAnimator mAnimator by calling the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofFloat (Object view, String xPropertyName, String yPropertyName, Path path)
     *     that animates coordinates along Path path using the two properties. A Path animation
     *     moves in two dimensions, animating coordinates (x, y) together to follow the line.
     *     In this variation, the coordinates are floats that are set to separate properties
     *     designated by xPropertyName and yPropertyName.
     * R.id.property_components: "Property Components" Use two Properties for individual (x, y)
     *     coordinates of the Path and sets them on the view object. An int version of this method
     *     also exists for animating int Properties. This is accomplished by creating an
     *     ObjectAnimator mAnimator by calling the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(T target, android.util.Property<T, java.lang.Float> xProperty,
     *           android.util.Property<T, java.lang.Float> yProperty, android.graphics.Path path)
     *     which returns an ObjectAnimator that animates coordinates of the target along a Path
     *     using the two properties. A Path animation moves in two dimensions, animating coordinates
     *     (x, y) together to follow the line. In this variation, the coordinates are floats that
     *     are set to separate properties, xProperty and yProperty.
     * R.id.multi_int: "Multi-int" Use a multi-int setter to animate along a Path. The method
     *     setCoordinates(int x, int y) is called on this during the animation. Either
     *     "setCoordinates" or "coordinates" are acceptable parameters because the "set" can
     *     be implied. This is accomplished by creating an ObjectAnimator mAnimator by calling
     *     the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofMultiInt (Object target, String propertyName, Path path)
     *     which returns an ObjectAnimator that animates the target using a multi-int setter along
     *     the given Path. A Path animation moves in two dimensions, animating coordinates (x, y)
     *     together to follow the line. In this variation, the coordinates are integer x and y
     *     coordinates used in the first and second parameter of the setter, respectively.
     * R.id.multi_float: "Multi-float" Use a multi-float setter to animate along a Path. The method
     *     changeCoordinates(float x, float y) is called on this during the animation. This is
     *     accomplished by creating an ObjectAnimator mAnimator by calling the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofMultiFloat(Object target, String propertyName, Path path) which
     *     returns an ObjectAnimator that animates the target using a multi-float setter along
     *     the given Path. A Path animation moves in two dimensions, animating coordinates
     *     (x, y) together to follow the line. In this variation, the coordinates are float x
     *     and y coordinates used in the first and second parameter of the setter, respectively.
     * R.id.named_setter: "Named Property" Use the named "point" property to animate along the
     *     Path. There must be a method setPoint(PointF) on the animated object. Because setPoint
     *     takes a PointF parameter, no TypeConverter is necessary. In this case, the animated
     *     object is PathAnimations. This is accomplished by creating an ObjectAnimator mAnimator
     *     by calling the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofObject(Object target, String propertyName, TypeConverter<PointF, ?> converter, Path path)
     *     which returns an ObjectAnimator that animates the target using a PointF to follow
     *     the Path. If the Property associated with propertyName uses a type other than PointF,
     *     converter can be used to change from PointF to the type associated with the Property.
     * R.id.property_setter: "Property" Use the POINT_PROPERTY property to animate along the Path.
     *     POINT_PROPERTY takes a Point, not a PointF, so the TypeConverter PointFToPointConverter
     *     is necessary. This is accomplished by creating an ObjectAnimator mAnimator  by calling
     *     the method:
     *     ObjectAnimator.ofObject(T target, Property<T, V> property, TypeConverter<PointF, V> converter, Path path)
     *     which returns an ObjectAnimator that animates the target using a PointF to follow the
     *     Path. Since property uses a type other than PointF, TypeConverter PointFToPointConverter
     *     is used to change from PointF to the type Point associated with the Property.
     *
     * Having created an ObjectAnimator mAnimator of the desired type based on the RadioButton
     * selected, we set the duration of mAnimator to 10000 milliseconds. the repeat mode to
     * RESTART, the repeat count to INFINITE, and the Interpolator to an instance of
     * LinearInterpolator then start the animation running.
