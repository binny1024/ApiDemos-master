/**
 * Entry into our redirection example, describing what will happen.

 * Consists of three activities: RedirectEnter, RedirectGetter, and RedirectMain.
 * RedirectGetter stores user input in the shared preference file "RedirectData"
 * RedirectEnter just describes what will happen, and when the "Go" button is
 * clicked starts up RedirectMain, which immediately starts RedirectGetter if
 * there is no data stored in "RedirectData" yet, if there is data it will display
 * it and give the user the options to either "Clear and Exit" back to RedirectEnter,
 * or "New Text" which restarts RedirectGetter. RedirectMain uses the request
 * codes INIT_TEXT_REQUEST, and NEW_TEXT_REQUEST that it sends in the Intent to
 * RedirectGetter to determine what to do if the result code was RESULT_CANCELED,
 * either finish() back to RedirectEnter, or just display the old text.
