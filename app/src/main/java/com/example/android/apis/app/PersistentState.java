/**
 * Simple example of using persistent preferences to retain a screen's state.
 * <p>This can be used as an alternative to the normal
 * <b>onSaveInstanceState()</b> mechanism, if you
 * wish the state to persist even after an activity is finished.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that using this approach requires more care, since you are sharing
 * the persistent state potentially across multiple instances of the activity.
 * In particular, if you allow a new instance of the activity to be launched
 * directly on top of the existing instance, the state can get out of sync
 * because the new instance is resumed before the old one is paused.</p>
 *
 * <p>For any persistent state that is not simplistic, a content
 * provider is often a better choice.</p>
 *
 * <p>In this example we are currently saving and restoring the state of the
 * top text editor, but not of the bottom text editor.  You can see the difference
 * by editing the two text fields, then going back from the activity and
 * starting it again.</p>
